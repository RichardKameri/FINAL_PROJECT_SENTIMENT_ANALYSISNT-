1,"I just completed a direct flight from NBO to JFK that lasted 15 hours. I wish it had been a layover flight with another airline. My original flight schedule was modified four weeks before departure, which forced us to change our travel plans. Although it was advertised as part of SkyTeam, my Delta Platinum Medallion status didn’t enable me to secure a complimentary seat closer to the front, and I ended up sitting four rows from the back of the plane. I asked for water during the flight, but the flight attendant never returned with it, forcing me to ask twice. It was unacceptable to only receive a cup of water during a 15-hour flight. Additionally, the air circulation was so poor that I ended up catching a cold.",2024-12-30,133,True,trip verified i just completed a direct flight from nbo to jfk that lasted hours i wish it had been a layover flight with another airline my original flight schedule was modified four weeks before departure which forced us to change our travel plans although it was advertised as part of skyteam my delta platinum medallion status didn t enable me to secure a complimentary seat closer to the front and i ended up sitting four rows from the back of the plane i asked for water during the flight but the flight attendant never returned with it forcing me to ask twice it was unacceptable to only receive a cup of water during a hour flight additionally the air circulation was so poor that i ended up catching a cold,-0.8093,negative
2,"Worst airline I've ever dealt with. 4hr delay on first flight due to ""engineering issues"". Left sitting on the plane with no aircon or lights while they worked it out. Next flight, air con didn't work after about 30mins into flight and the flight became an over. Very old and tired planes and the seats feel like you're sitting on metal. They cancelled today's flight and moved me to another flight without telling me. And then put my Dad on a separate flight. Staff at the help desk were rude and kept passing me from one line to another. When I asked for names, they refused to provide them so I took a photo to report them and they then demanded I delete the photo or they'd call security. I complied, but they called security anyway and still wouldn't provide names. In the end, we still ended up being put on separate flights, mine 8hrs after the original flight I'd booked. The only saving grace was the staff on the plane were at least friendly and polite. But nothing else positive to say.",2024-12-24,187,True,trip verified worst airline i ve ever dealt with hr delay on first flight due to engineering issues left sitting on the plane with no aircon or lights while they worked it out next flight air con didn t work after about mins into flight and the flight became an over very old and tired planes and the seats feel like you re sitting on metal they cancelled today s flight and moved me to another flight without telling me and then put my dad on a separate flight staff at the help desk were rude and kept passing me from one line to another when i asked for names they refused to provide them so i took a photo to report them and they then demanded i delete the photo or they d call security i complied but they called security anyway and still wouldn t provide names in the end we still ended up being put on separate flights mine hrs after the original flight i d booked the only saving grace was the staff on the plane were at least friendly and polite but nothing else positive to say,0.6164,positive
3,"Not Verified |  By far, the worst customer service received. Unethical, unreliable and unknowledgeable. Flight coming back to US moved 6 hours before original time of departure, last minute. Missed the flight, due to this drastic flight change. I was stranded in Zanzibar. and had to add another hotel for the night stay since I had missed the flight. Had paid for premium economy seats which was not granted due to the last minute booking. Therefore, I requested a refund for the Hotel stay and premium seats that was not granted as paid. Since Aug 2024 calling, emailing every other week for an update on a refund. The staff all sounds like robots, no training; they all repeat the same sentence, call back with in 72hrs; its been 4 months, they don't reply to emails, either. Literally, fighting for less than $280. Learned my lesson to stick to what you know. By now, a well known airline would've reimburse $280.00 miserable dollars due to their negligence. There was no justification for such a drastic flight change, weather was fine and I would've accepted the flight change if this was notified 72hrs ahead, not last minute.

8,"On 24th November 2024, I flew from Lagos to Mumbai with a one-hour layover in Nairobi. The flight KQ533 from Lagos arrived on time in Nairobi, and the flight to Mumbai (KQ204) was scheduled to take off at 8:45 PM local time. We were informed it would depart at 10:45 PM but actually took off at 11:40 PM for Mumbai. I felt tired and dozed off upon takeoff. I woke up an hour later to find that all my co-travellers were having dinner, but there was no meal on my seat. As I was hungry, I immediately pressed the call bell, but nobody came to attend to me. I got up from my seat and went to the back of the plane, where I found three male attendants gossiping. I asked them why they did not serve me a meal and if they could not see the call light. They responded by saying they do not wake up passengers who are asleep, and thus my meal was not served. I was shocked and told them that the rule of not waking a passenger applies to flights scheduled for 12:00 midnight, but this flight was scheduled to leave at 8:45 PM, with dinner included in the itinerary. Even if the flight was delayed and the passenger was asleep, it is the duty of the flight attendants to politely wake the passenger and offer meals or check later. I raised my voice slightly. In response, one attendant raised his voice and told me not to shout, while the other two mellowed down and said they would bring the meal to my seat. They eventually did. After we all slept for about seven hours, we woke up ready for landing. All of us were thirsty after the long sleep, but none of the flight staff came to offer passengers water. Instead, they preferred to remain at the back of the plane. When I asked for water, they said they would get back to me, but nobody returned. Like cattle, we disembarked the plane after landing. None of the staff stood along the walkway to wish us goodbye.

9,"In late July 2024, our flight from Zanzibar to Nairobi had first been postponed to a later time several hours before departure. Due to weather conditions, we were unable to land in Nairobi on time and diverted to Kilimanjaro. This incident obviously meant that our connecting flight to Amsterdam was already gone. Once we arrived in Nairobi, Kenya airways could not help us pay for a visa for 4 people. We were able to stay in a hotel near the airport, but had to pay for the visa ourselves as their payment system was not working. We were not given any luggage and therefore walked around in the same clothes for 3 days. Kenya Airways promised to refund all charges if we handed in the receipts has not happened to this day.

13,"I travel frequently between Nairobi and Johannesburg. Due to Kenya Airways' notoriously unreliable services (frequent delays, cancellations and last minute aircraft changes), I switched to using their much more reliable competitor on the route last year. However, due to my work schedule on my trip today, I was compelled to use KQ again and it was like I had never been away. My ticket for today's flight showed a Boeing 787 which was also the aircraft depicted when I checked in online the day before the flight. I selected and paid for an Economy Comfort seat. Upon checking in at the airport today, I received a boarding pass for said seat and proceeded to the boarding gate, where a B787 sat parked. However, 40 minutes before departure, the KQ staff at the gate announced that the aircraft was being swapped to a Boeing 737-800 and all passengers would have to line up again at the desk and be reseated. Cue complete bedlam as an unruly line formed with people jumping the queue and arguing with the belligerent KQ staff. Processing the passengers took ages and of course, I lost my Economy Comfort seat and was told to email KQ to obtain a refund. Note that this has happened to me twice before and I have yet to receive a refund for the previous occurrences. The flight departed over an hour late as a result.

16,"Travelled Paris to Joburg through Nairobi 23-24th August 2024 on B787 and B737, respectively. All flights on time. Checked in with breeze in CDG and went to the excellent lounge in Terminal 2E Hall K. The lounge is very good, despite becoming one of the oldest Skyteam lounges in Paris and is undergoing a soft rehabilitation. The food theme was turkey in various kinds of delicious dishes. Champagnes offered from a wandering trolley with special snacks. New beers and IPAs offered complementing the trivial Heineken. Evening/night flight. Boarding easy, welcome drinks provided, FAs were nice. I always sleep well in KQs B787s and lost my dinner dozing off and woke up only at 03 a.m. Then, I inquired successfully dine-on-demand, and got my preordered, hot seafood meal with a giant salmon starter. We also got breakfast prior to arrival in NBO. Got an amenity kit, though no pajama. Pride lounge in NBO is nice and convenient, spacious with good tarmac views. Had morning shower prior to my next flight to JNB which also left on time. That was a narrowbody without lie-flat seats, but the business class atmosphere was clearly felt throughout, apart from completely lack of flight entertainment. I had welcome champagne and ate and drank as I could and wanted to. Special meals were given; also, other meals were tried out and were deemed good, inclusive a beef dish from economy class. Luggage arrived in Johannesburg without any issues. Had to check it in again on another airline, Rwandair, to Kigali.

17,"The good: on board, crew friendly The bad: flight delays and cancellings Several hours before my flight from Daressalam to Nairobi I received an email, that the flight would be postponed by 1 hour, which would it make difficult to reach the next flight from Nairobi to Paris. While I was arriving at the airport KQ sent me another email, that my flight from Nairobi to Paris was cancelled. I went to the KQ counter and they told me that they don't have a solution but they would check me in anyways and once in Nairobi I should ask for a solution at the KQ service desk. I checked in and my luggage was checked though until the final destination (Munich). At this moment I already knew that my suitcases would get lost. In Nairobi KQ booked a flight for me at 6:30am from Nairobi to Paris, but they had no flight from Paris to Munich and told me to ask them in the morning before boarding. In the morning they provided me a flight at 8:30pm from Paris to Munich with Lufthansa, which I accepted since it was the only available option. Of course the flight to Paris was delayed by 1 hour and the boarding organisation was very chaotic. There was no separate queue for the biz passengers and I had to step over sitting other passengers or push them aside to board my biz seat. KQ and their partner AF were absolutely no help for me, because they just said go to terminal 1 to the Lufthansa counter to get your boarding pass. To reach terminal 1 I had to pass 3 security checks and on every check they asked for my boarding pass, which I didn't have - thanks to KQ and AF. It took me more than 2 hours to reach terminal 1.

18,"I have never seen such a disaster. In the plane out of 7 only 1 screen worked. They overbooked our connecting flight in Nairobi. So without warning, without giving any explanation, without apologizing, we are forced to spend a night in Nairobi. So to get a visa. The visa application malfunctioned, we landed at 8:30 p.m. and had to leave for Madagascar at 10:30 p.m. As a result we left Nairobi airport for a hotel at 2am. All this without accompaniment without a bottle of water or anything. The hotel was so noisy that we didn't sleep a wink all night. We only leave the next day at 12:30 p.m. for an arrival in Antananarivo at 3:30 p.m. on August 3 instead of 1:30 a.m. on August 2. As a result, we paid for our hotel night in Antananarivo for nothing and we lost a day of vacation. An unforeseen event during a trip is part of the game, but deliberately overbooking and causing families to experience such inconvenience when the ticket costs €1,300 per person is simply shameful. There is no professionalism from the staff, no empathy, all this seems normal to them and once again the crazy thing is that in all these imposed steps you have to fend for yourself because no one tells you anything. We feel that there is no desire for customer service but just to make money. Better to pay a little more and not get cheated. This is simply dishonest. Never again from this company. | Je n’ai jamais vu une telle catastrophe. Dans l’avion sur 7 seulement 1 écran fonctionnait. Ils ont fait du surbooking sur notre vol de correspondance à Nairobi. Du coup sans prévenir, sans donner aucune explication, sans s’excuser on nous oblige à passer une nuit à Nairobi. Donc à faire un visa. L’application pour faire le visa dysfonctionait , nous avons atterri à 20h30, devions repartir pour Madagascar à 22h30. Résultat nous sommes partis de l’aéroport de Nairobi pour un hôtel à 2h du matin. Tout cela sans accompagnement sans une bouteille d’eau ni rien. L’hôtel était tellement bruyant que nous n’avons pas fermé l’œil de la nuit. Nous repartons seulement le lendemain à 12h30 pour une arrivée à Antananarivo à 15h30 le 3 août au lieu de 01h30 le 02 août. Résultat nous avons payé notre nuit d’hôtel à Antananarivo pour rien et nous avons perdu une journée de vacances. Un imprévu lors d’un voyage fait parti du jeu mais faire volontairement du surbooking et faire vivre de tels désagréments aux familles alors que le billet est à 1300€ par personne c’est tout simplement honteux.

25,"Joburg-Nairobi-Amsterdam 26-27 June 2024 on Boeings 787-8. Checked in online from Rwanda and came to Joburg in transit for positioning. I arrived very early and would have to spend some 10-12 hours in the airport. However, the Kenya airways staff at the JNB transfer desk, a Ms. Nosisi, was kind, talkative, and very cooperative allowing me to depart on a 7 hours earlier flight. I then would avoid excessive time in JNB a tight onward connection in Nairobi. She did this, without any pay for ticket change, BP renewals, and retagging the luggage. I even got a much greater trip on a Dreamliner instead on my scheduled B737, which was another win as they have wide lie-down seats. My only cost was to forsake a preordered meal. The SAA lounge in JNB is gorgeous, impressive, and world class, now used by Skyteam, Star Alliance, and a number of airlines, as SAA have very few flights these days. The catering, bar, tarmac views, and space are all world class. From Kenya Airways, Ms. Nosisi, even came up to the lounge to find me in person to confirm my new boarding. She assured me that the inscribed luggage had passed security check and was onboard this earlier flight. Boarding easy though had to stand 25 Minutes in an airbridge, until the cabin was fully ready. Onboard, seats, and IFE was fully functioning. Catering was good and preordered meal accommodated on the last leg. Plenty of drinks of acceptable standard, though nothing extravagant. Only Tusker beer is offered; it’s of poor quality. Food tasty, well presented and extra hot dishes given on request. One meal service when going to Nairobi (4 hours flight) and two meal services while going to Amsterdam (8 hours). Pre-departure champagne is still their beloved JB Gobillard. FAs are good, attentive, and caring. Drink offerings onboard appear to be generous/unlimited. WiFi onboard useless. IFE fairly good. Transfer/transit in Nairobi went smooth, though we had to disembark by busses in the middle of night. The busses got filled, no premium toward business class nor Skyteam priority. Security checks quick. Pride lounge is good but was full, likely due to their new Asante Awards FFP with status match of elite-fliers offered widely, granting excessive access to the lounge which are now used at absolute maximum capacity. I watched the UEFA 2024 football tournament on TV; eventually, I even got a bed in the sleeper section to recharge for my next flight in the morning. Woke up early and got a lovely breakfast and shower prior to boarding to AMS was not very far from the lounge, all went smooth and on time. This flight to AMS had more perks than the previous. I got one more hot meal service round, amenity kit, mattress, etc. Arrived at Amsterdam as scheduled, and continued with their partner, KLM.

36,"I really wanted to like Kenya Airways but sadly I cannot. Firstly, our original booking was changed by the airline several months before travel. What was a Thursday flight with a 90-minute connection in NBO turned into a Friday flight with a 10-hour layover in NBO. Instead of arriving at our destination late afternoon on Friday, it became 3am on Sunday and we effectively lost 2 days of vacation. The airline would not entertain courtesy access to the lounge due to the involuntary delay (shown as US$100 for 2 adults and a child including Asante discount) but said they would pay for a day hotel outside the airport. However, they also would not pay the US$100+ to get the required ETA to leave the airport for our group to get to the hotel so it was pointless. Check-in at JFK was smooth, and the staff were friendly, even if there was a hitch meaning we could not check in online ahead of time. We were asked to pay again for the seats we had already paid US$50 per person for. This was because of whatever they did on the back-end to change our tickets from the Thursday to the Friday zeroed out our payment. We were able to show them the original booking and receipts and the fee was ""waived"". On-board the flight, the staff from JFK-NBO were not particularly friendly and the seats we had paid for had inoperable IFE system. (19 G/H/J for reference). The cabin crew tried to reset it 2 or 3 times but could not make it work. 14 hours without any entertainment. great! This was not new damage as the remote was missing in the middle seat and frayed ends showed it was not recent. Perhaps that is why the cabin crew pretty much avoided our section of the plane (as the people behind us had inoperable IFE also). We only saw them for meal service and they did not engage whatsoever. I am sure they had received complaints on the incoming flight also! After a very long flight we arrived at NBO and transited to the lounge. Not KQ's fault but only 1 security line open and people backed up all the way up the still moving escalator!! Took about 1 hour to get through but when we did we went to the lounge. Asked again about complimentary access but met with a firm ""no"". (which we expected but you have to ask!). What we did not expect was that the cost would be US$160 if we wanted to stay until our next flight and not $100 as quoted by KQ. We paid it as we were tired and wanted some nap time and some rest. Lounge was average in terms of food, but it was clean and quiet. Staff were also excellent. The flight from NBO to SEZ later in the evening was uneventful in comparison. We got on the plane, it was half full only, staff were great, IFE worked, legroom was decent, and it landed on time. What more could you ask. If there was a complaint about this flight it would be the time. 3:15AM is really late to land (or early depending on point of view), everything is closed so we couldn't get sim cards we had paid for until next day and had to book an extra day at accommodation so we could check in so early. We had hoped KQ would live up to our expectation (we had flown them in 2020 just before the pandemic hit and they were great) but realistically, the planes are looking shoddy on the inside now, and there are other options to get to SEZ and even to NBO many of which were cheaper, and we might opt for those if there is a next time to SEZ.

38,"We were delayed leaving Amsterdam by 2 and a half hours. So we missed our connection to Lusaka. We were rebooked on the next flight 5 hours later. I checked an Independent site for departures from Nairobi today and it said our 1:30 pm departure for Nairobi was delayed until 18:30. Our 3rd delay on this trip. I told the staff in the lounge this and they assured me I was wrong. Of course I was right and knew more than the Kenya Airways staff who only got the news at the boarding gate. Their display board still has our flight leaving in time at 1:30 pm. They never change hoping that in some parallel universe their lies may be believed. They offer nothing by way of compensation even though this flight originated in the EU. Compensation sites don't deal with Kenya Airways as they refuse to pay. The staff couldn't care less but I don't think they can be blamed for being so uninformed. They offer at business class a free dump if a hotel (not a known brand) but here's the catch.

39,"Flew from Bangkok via Nairobi to Kigali 2nd April 2024 on B787-800 and B737-800, respectively. Both flights were about full and briefly on time. I had chosen my favorite seats beforehand (free for elite card status holders). Easy and fast check-in in BKK, including being given unofficial advice on how to enter Fast Track for Immigration and Security. These used to be a Skypriority perk, but they have cancelled this except for premium class travellers. The Skyteam lounge in pier F delivers and still improves on hot foods and French sparkling wine. First flight called for boarding far too early, almost 2 hours before scheduled departure. The F5 gate as KQ uses, however, is only 200 meters away from the lounge so I went back again as the dull gate hall atmosphere kills my mood. Airbridge while boarding, but bus-gating while exiting in Nairobi. Onboard could stretch my legs as I wanted as the 25th row has unlimited leg-space and they availed space to me avoiding having someone sitting at the neighbouring seat. That later enabled me to sleep well. Preordered seafood was delivered to perfection with handwritten name on it. So, we had dinner at 2 a.m., but it was very welcomed. The flight provided me 3 hot meals which is more than fair for a 9 hours flight. Inquired and got an extra portion of different nature, a freshwater fish meal, which also proved tasty. The most delicious meal was, to my surprise, the breakfast. Here they’ve made seafood pieces into scrambled eggs, extremely delicious and innovative. Drinks came around late and after food was served. The Tusker beer was awful, the white wine was undrinkable, but the red wine was surprisingly good (Shiraz grape from Stonedale Winery, South Africa). No bubbles in economy class, however. The FAs managed well the full flight. They answered call bells, were fit, jovial, and well rested, focusing on their job and talkative with passengers. Transfer in Nairobi was tedious due to bus drive and huge queues for security checks. Thus, I missed the lounge. Last flight to Kigali was more spartanic and uneventful, had to cheer up the staff. Exit seats reclinable (row 19), was again given a neighbour free seat. Boarding upon walking on the tarmac 300 meters. Catering was only a plain, cold croissant (short morning flight), but hot and soft drinks were frequently served. IFE working well (both flights) but headsets not provided.

42,"Not Verified |  My recent experience with Kenya Airways was incredibly disappointing. During a transit from Nairobi to Addis Ababa, the airline made a critical mistake, resulting in us missing our connecting flight. Despite having a transit time of only one hour and 40 minutes, we were left stranded at the airport for over 24 hours without any proper assistance. After the airline acknowledged their error, they offered no immediate solution or support. We were left to fend for ourselves, with no food provided and no accommodation arranged, forcing us to sleep on uncomfortable chairs in the waiting area. Attempts to seek assistance from the manager were futile, as no help was provided. Furthermore, the lack of options for purchasing food at reasonable prices within the airport, coupled with restrictions on bringing food from outside, only added to our frustration. This experience not only caused significant inconvenience but also led to me missing out on a special occasion. I strongly advise against using Kenya Airways and urge fellow travelers to consider alternative options. The lack of basic care and assistance during such a distressing situation is unacceptable, and I have no intention of flying with this airline again.",2024-03-04,198,False,not verified my recent experience with kenya airways was incredibly disappointing during a transit from nairobi to addis ababa the airline made a critical mistake resulting in us missing our connecting flight despite having a transit time of only one hour and minutes we were left stranded at the airport for over hours without any proper assistance after the airline acknowledged their error they offered no immediate solution or support we were left to fend for ourselves with no food provided and no accommodation arranged forcing us to sleep on uncomfortable chairs in the waiting area attempts to seek assistance from the manager were futile as no help was provided furthermore the lack of options for purchasing food at reasonable prices within the airport coupled with restrictions on bringing food from outside only added to our frustration this experience not only caused significant inconvenience but also led to me missing out on a special occasion i strongly advise against using kenya airways and urge fellow travelers to consider alternative options the lack of basic care and assistance during such a distressing situation is unacceptable and i have no intention of flying with this airline again,-0.9531,negative

44,"Kigali to Amsterdam via Nairobi 4th Feb. 2024. Ticket cheap, promotional, purchased instantly after KQ resumed their NBO flights to China via Bangkok. Trip started well, check-in in KGL clear though tedious (20-40 minutes per person in Skypriority line!). Luggage inscribed the whole way inclusive of an additional leg to Hanoi on another ticket with Vietnam Airlines, another SkyTeam alliance member. That would ease my transfer in BKK. Later, the trip became an unreasonable lengthy Odyssey over 4 days: due to just a two hours delayed departure from KGL, I missed connection NBO-BKK which was closed at gate (or cancelled; I have different information on this). First, KQ sent me from the now closed gate 11 in NBO to gate 8 to board with Qatar Airways to DOH and then to HAN (final destination). However, I had to decline as only NBO-DOH was booked and acknowledged by QR. The remaining sector was not booked and QR refused to book me through to Hanoi. Then I had to queue up at KQ-transfer desks, who eventually told me that they alternatively would provide me hotel in Kenya until their next departure 2 days later (!!). On top, they further needed a supervisors approval to this long stay. I would go on next direct flight, but had to await ticket re-issuance. In the meantime they sent me to their Prime Lounge in NBO to wait for details. Went airside/landside/airside and had to endure 2 security checks. The details dragged on; however, at 4 a.m. I was, without any dialogue, laconically, sent a rebooked itinerary NBO-AMS by KQ and then AMS-BKK by KLM. That detour implied a 2-3 times longer trip with arrival in BKK a day later than planned. They then saved on hotels but added on flight costs. I thought I better accept this solution as to discuss options seemed not easy and I was too tired to make a fuss, and would then arrive a day earlier than feared. Those two trips went well; I narrowly managed transfer in AMS, but my luggage was not following me. It apparently stayed on in Nairobi; this I arrived BKK without my luggage. It only arrived there with KQs own flight the following day. I had in the meantime postponed and rebooked my onwards tickets with Vietnam Airlines who of course could not sent my luggage with me as it had not yet arrived Bangkok yet. However VN did a great job to retrieve it and eventually submitted it to my private address in Vietnam upon an extra day and some ongoing actions from my side. Not to the benefit of Kenya Airways… Flight 1 Apart from the delay, it was a fine trip on a well occupied B737-800. Lounge in Kigali was accessed through my Flying Blue Gold Card and was a pleasure. Food is good, including several hot dishes and savory snacks. Drink options are very sparse but well stocked. As usual, gate calls in Kigali are done way too early and even before arriving aircrafts have landed. If adhered to, one would sit in the dull gate area for 1-2 hours instead of enjoying the lounge to a maximum. Thus, I refused to be chased out of lounge early as there were no reason to rush for nothing. Boarding easy. Onboard, I got my wanted seat and preordered seafood-meal. Wines onboard are drinkable as compared to those served in the lounge. Flight 2 a Boeing 787 aircraft, a bit worn. On time.

47,"This is our first time flying with Kenya airways & will be the last. We are in Africa for a 25th anniversary trip & we were flying (KQ flight 471) from Kigali to Nairobi on 19th Jan 2024. We arrived at the airport at 7 am for the 9.10 am flight. Minutes after take-off, the pilot announced that we were returning to the gate, as a ""door latch wasn't closing"" & they needed to have it looked at. At around 10 am, after half an hour sitting on the flight, they said we needed to get off & they would give us an update. After sitting around for 3 hours, at 1 pm, we were told that we would be put on a flight at 7 pm, and that they were going to bus us to a hotel for lunch & to wait. We had a flight to Zanzibar at 6.30 pm on Jan 19th, but since we weren't even supposed to leave Kigali till 7 pm, we knew we would not make our connection. The Kenya Airways rep assured all of us that all of us would ""automatically"" be booked onto connecting flights & we didn't have to worry about a thing. Since matters were out of our hands at that time, We left with our fellow passengers & were taken to a not so nice hotel, where we were told to have lunch & wait for an update. At around 5 pm, the reception informed us that Kenya Airways had updated them that we were no longer going on the 7 pm flight, but were going to be out on a 3.40 am flight to Nairobi, the next day, January 20th. It would be more 17 hours past our original departure time, but we had no option but to wait it out, as our bags were still at the airport. Somehow, we all made it to 1 am at night, when a bus arrived to take us back to Kigali airport. Upon arrival, we were told that the 3.40 am flight(KQ 479) was delayed till 4.40 am. To make things even more chaotic, our connecting flight to Zanzibar(KQ 490) was also already delayed from 8 am to 11.20 am. I'm writing this as I sit at the airport, hoping to finally get to Zanzibar today. The total flight time from Kigali to Nairobi & Nairobi to Zanzibar is 3 hours or so, and thanks to Kenya Airways, we have already spent 27 hours at the airport & the hotel & we still don't know if we will actually get to Zanzibar today. And if our bags will be on the Zanzibar flight. Time will tell. It's only now that I'm reading all the terrible reviews of Kenya Airways. We experienced the terrible customer service first hand, with agents not having any replies to questions, absolutely no apologies from any staff for the agony caused, and long lines of angry customers at every counter. The horror stories are real. Avoid this airline like the plague, if you value your peace of mind. Anyone can understand one aircraft having ""operational issues"". But from what we saw and experienced, cancellations, delays, no accountability & no apologies are a daily way of life for Kenya Airways. How can an airline get it so wrong, so many times?

Eventually we took off but upon worries expressed by captain, we became forced to return back to Nairobi, despite we were almost already at Dar. 150 passengers then had to sit in the aircraft or debark into a bus on the tarmac in Nairobi. There were no proper announcements, no service, no toilet access, just waiting in limbo for hours. Some passengers refused to reboard as they lost faith in the airline and aircraft. Then these passengers luggage had to be offloaded, another hour went by. The whole night was completely destroyed; however, at last we took off but only arrived in Dar early morning instead of at midnight as scheduled.

79,"I have been flying with Kenya Airways for the past 6 years, experienced a delay once which was okay but I had the worst experience in May where both trips were a disappointment. First, on the 14th May my Departure was delayed from 6am to 4pm. No apologies nothing, they kept on rescheduling the flight without proper communication. We late boarded Emirates to Nairobi. Again it took us hours to board from Nairobi to Mombasa.

On the screen I could see clearly my flight displayed at 8:45pm.Seriously ! Without even sending a notification, remember while booking phone number and email address is always part of the reservation details. The staff showed no remorse and asked me to check with reservation team. I walked politely to KQ office. I was so shocked when the reservation agent told me that my ticket is not valid ,that it's just a paper - so from changing the time to my ticket being void. This was the worst respond ever! Kenya airways staff lie a lot. He even told me that they tried to send a notification of which he wasn't sure.

80,"At a time when many airlines are improving their product, Kenya Airways appears to be going in the opposite direction. Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers – for the airline ‘Sky Priority’ means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was ‘reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it’. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew ‘could not find me anywhere to sit’. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways’ 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly.

84,"Kigali - Nairobi - Entebbe return 26-27 March 2023. Aircraft were narrowbodies. The first flight was on a B737, while the three remaining flights were on E190’s. All four (short-haul) flights were on time. This was a Mileage Run to retain my Flying Blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month. I was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in Kigali. They said, upon liaising with Immigration I Airport, that my reason to travel was not valid. I tried to change purpose, but the damage was done, which forced me to postpone the entire trip. However, later I had the ticket reissued by KQ town office in Kigali, who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a No Show case. They even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs. I even got a much better (and more expensive) itinerary avoiding night-flights though extending my transit lounge stays. While the junior KQ staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding, the KQ staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the OTA. The rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects. Lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights, and the lounges are all of good and solid quality. Slept fine in Pride Lounge in Nairobi where I spent an eve and a night. Effective boardings/deboardings by either bus, on foot, or by jetbridge. Onboard, welcome champagne available on all four flights. I had prebooked seat 1A which was given me throughout. I preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty. The sole exception was a morning flight, where they could not manage my seafood, despite it appeared in their flight manuscript; not a big issue, but they apologised. KQ always manage special meals effectively; this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like Qatar Airways or KLM allows for. The crews on all flights were fine, professional, caring, and in good mood. The food is getting better on these regional flights, and I had my tasty hot mini-meals served throughout. Hot towels provided. Nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks, which were served several times. The challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turn-around in EBB to which airport staff were confused as I instantly returned to my origin without going landside. They allowed me not to buy a transit visa, and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me – I was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours. Onboard, no IFE and no WiFi which is fine for short flights. No luggage/baggage issues. Flying Blue status respected and some SkyPriority entitlements were given. E.g. priority boarding. Recommended.

85,"This review is regarding Kenya Airways customer service and has nothing to do with the details of a specific flight. Our return to Chicago was cancelled when the KA pilots went on strike. My family of four was left to arrange alternate flight arrangements by ourselves and our travel agent who was back in Chicago. We absolutely received no help from anyone at KA. Finally got economy class tickets with Turkish Air which we took from Nairobi to Istanbul and home to Chicago. Had to pay for those tickets and was told to wait for a refund of the return with KA for our cancelled business class tickets. As it turned out, we had to wait a while for our refund which finally arrived on Feb 27. The refund was issued for almost $1200 each ($4800 for the four of us). While this may sound fair, please consider that we paid a total of $14,647 for our four business class round trip tickets to Nairobi and back. Additionally, we had to pay for our return via Turkish Air at a total of $6356. So the refund represented less than 1/3rd of the cost of the original round trip tickets. We were hoping for some consideration of the cost we incurred with Turkish Air, which ultimately was caused by KA. Following a recommendation from the CEO of KA I was contacted by one of his subordinates. While, I do believe that this individual may have had some impact upon the processing of the refund, I disagreed with him on numerous occasions when he and his staff tried to explain the refund policy to me following disruptions in service. The following is a direct quote from his email to regarding these situations: “In the event of disruptions such as the strike, the airline makes arrangements to carry you at the earliest opportunity on one of our scheduled services or reroute you to the destination shown on the ticket by our own services or those of another carrier at no additional cost to you. Should the alternative flights not be suitable or we are unable to rebook you to an alternate flight, you are entitled to a refund of the value of the unused portion of your tickets.” I contended to him that neither myself nor any member of my family was approached by anyone from KA to reroute us OR that anybody at the KA desk was willing to assist us make alternate flight arrangements. I was particularly incensed when I read the words in red, stating “…at no additional cost to you.” I feel lied to and disrespected by Kenya Airways in their addressing our significant and inconvenient disruption of service. I have found examples of other travelers on our flight similarly affected by the strike who had desk clerks reroute them with no additional out of pocket expenditure.

We eventually left and arrived too late for our connecting flight to Johannesburg. Kenia Airways wasn’t prepared at all for this eventuality even though they knew about it for more than 12 hours.

After being sent to 3 different counters we were directed to the Airlink Customer Service Centre. Here we met our angel who checked and assured us that the luggage never arrived in Dar Es Salaam which means that Airlink didn’t receive it from Kenia Airways. This meant it wasn’t Airlinks responsibility anymore, but they then told us that they will load an enquiry and get the process going. Upon loading, he realized that the luggage was still in Nairobi but was scheduled to be on Flight KQ760 on 7/1/2023.

120,"This is the worst airline I have ever flown. We booked roundtrip direct flights to Mauritius to and from Nairobi for our honeymoon. We planned to spend 7 days in Mauritius. The night before our flight from Nairobi to Mauritius, I was emailed (yes, emailed) at 11.19pm while I was sleeping to inform me that our flight time was to be changed from 1.00pm to 7.30am. As I was understandably sleeping at the time, I did not review this message until I woke up at 5.30am that morning. I was staying in Naivasha, Kenya at the time and so did not have time to make it to the airport. We immediately called due to the fact that we were going to miss our flight and no one was able to explain to us why this change was made so last minute to the flight schedule and why we were not informed ahead of time. I would think it would be common sense that an email in the middle of the night 8 hours prior to the new proposed flight time (for a now 7.30am flight) is insufficient notice. Even after speaking to multiple different Kenya Airways employees, I was never given a reason for the flight time change (just ""operations""). Ultimately we were rebooked for a flight late that day, but this was an indirect flight through Dubai, which didn't leave until 5.10pm and involved >16 hours of travel instead of what was supposed to be a 4 hour and 20 minute flight. Because of this, we were unable to check in for our hotel that we had paid for the night of our arrival and instead arrived the next morning, exhausted, having been traveling all night and transferring in Dubai in the middle of the night. To boot, the behaviour of the passengers on the plane from Nairobi to Dubai was absurd. People were constantly standing up on the plane and blocking the aisle even after being asked to sit down by flight attendants. Kids were running around unrestrained and flight attendants had to ask over the intercom for parents to restrain their children multiple times. In the row in front of me someone was watching a movie on a tablet with nonstop gunfire with the volume on max and he was not using headphones. To top it all off, in addition to missing our first night of the trip, Kenya Airways also changed our return flight time, moving it up from 7.10pm to 1.40pm. This effectively compromised two different days of our trip (as we were unable to do much the morning of our departure and were unable to take advantage of the late checkout that we were qualified for at our hotel). On top of it all, our return flight was ultimately delayed by 40 minutes and the process to check in our bags took an absurdly long time, longer than it has ever taken for any other flight I have been on. We had all of our documents and it still took us >10 minutes to complete the check in process and this was after standing in line for one hour waiting for the check in desk. Bottom line, if you can avoid it, do not fly on Kenya Airways. You will absolutely regret it.

122,"Flying from Lusaka to London via Nairobi last month with Kenya Airways was a shocking experience. Pre-departure tests are no longer needed upon arrival to England. However, my instinct told me to check if I needed a PCR to transit through Kenya. The COVID information on the Kenya Airways website is extremely misleading. When I filled in all the details about my trip, it said nothing about a PCR test; however, when I spoke to an agent on WhatsApp they said I need a PCR test as I am not vaccinated (screenshots attached). Having to rush around Lusaka the day before I flew to London, I eventually got a PCR test. I arrived at Lusaka Airport at 23:30 on Sunday and did not get my bags checked in until 01:10 on Monday (5 minutes before baggage drop off closes) due to the airline and staff's poor customs. I knew my bags were overweight and decided to pay the additional cost rather than repack. I was told that I cannot pay using card and can only pay in Kwacha or US Dollar. I had £100, which was roughly the additional cost and it took over 45 minutes for the staff to find out whether I could pay using British Pounds and inform me. The ATM I was advised to go to outside on the bottom floor of the airport was out of service and I had to run to the domestic airport (10 minutes from the international airport if you're in shape) to withdraw cash from the second nearest ATM. The total amount was 2066 Kwacha and when I presented 2100 Kwacha, I was told they did not have any change...

No apology, no information at check in. Boarding was chaotic as usual. They called for Business Class and Priority passengers to board first (I have Siver Elite status), only for everybody to end up on a bus that waited until it was full before proceeding to the airplane. So much for priority boarding. Even with the delayed departure time, the flight was delayed even further, departing at 1220. KQ is a disgrace.

Monrovia Airport is full of hustlers pretending to be from the airline but want tips and they are annoying, the airline should chase them away. Kenya Airways (KQ) uses a third party lounge in Monrovia which is small but good with courteous, proactive attendants. No champagne, but plenty of drinks and liquor. The local Club beer is good. Embarking easy, fast, not a single crosscheck from lounge to seat – what a pleasure. Onboard, welcome drinks were served. The seats were huge and well bolstered, reclining, new, and very comfortable. Could sleep. IFE or WiFi was only working on the last leg. No printed menus were given out, but the FAs asked each individual on food choices. My pre-ordered special sea food meals were all different, delicious, and served without reminders. Business Class was full after Accra, but I did neither feel cramped nor stuffy. FAs, all Kenyans, were good and caring – though maybe not world class. In NBO the Pride lounge did the job for me during the 12 hours’ layover.

126,"Flew Kigali to Monrovia over Nairobi and Accra on 8-9 May 2022. Flights on time. Checked in online worked well and got my BPs in airport swiftly. No luggage issues. Recognised as Skyteam elite. Kenya Airways staff came to me in lounge and, without request, carried my hand-luggage for me from lounge to the aircraft. No waiting time nor queues anywhere on the trip despite the flights were full or almost full. KQ delivers and have rarely let me down over the years. Pearl Lounge in Kigali delivers but suffers from deprived views of airport runways. First flight was on an Embraer 190 which is a lovely, roomy aircraft. Onboard, they allowed me to shift to an exit row as my original seat was mistakenly occupied by another person. The seat now offered was very nice - it would have cost me 50 USD if booked online. Drinks were generously provided. Appreciate Kenya Airways often have the Happy Hour concept where a request for a single drink most often triggers serving two. The wine in mini-bottles was acceptable, a South African “Stonedale”. I had requested seafood meal and I got it: it was a cold, tasty salmon sandwich. FAs were kind and effective. No IFE nor WiFi but on a 90 minutes flight its not an issue. Transit in Nairobi Airport smooth and quick. It took me only 15 Minutes to reach the KQ Pride Lounge. I love this lounge, roomy and curvy designs with lots of nice sections.

When I was running between the testing station and the check-in counter, she decided that I could leave my bag there (I was literally the only remaining customer, so she was just being kind) and took my number so I could run downstairs to go check on my results and she could call me once it was absolutely necessary for them to close the counter. She did call me, and while I was running a few minutes late, she spoke to her superiors who agreed that the time was negligible and I could therefore run back upstairs with my results while she waited to quickly send my bag through.

141,"I never thought I would experience the worst customer care from an airline which boast itself as “the Pride of Africa”. Trouble started during COVID-19 test verification at the check in desk. My family of six (2 adults and 4 kids) were supposed to travel to JFK via London on 24/8/21. Three of my kids had negative test results while the rest of us had turned positive earlier in the month but had been cleared by a health official to end the mandatory isolation on 13/8/21. As required by CDC, in order to travel to the US, a passenger needs to have either a negative test result or proof of recovery (positive test certificate and a discharge letter from a health official) if they were COVID positive within the last 90 days. We presented our fully compliant documents to the check in clerk, but instead of taking their time to confirm that indeed those were the documents that were required at our final destination, she automatically rejected them and said we all had to have negative test results, otherwise we would have to go back and wait until we all tested negative! They didn’t have any reference sheet or document to base their decision on, the only reference was to pretend that they had called an office “who deals with this sort of thing” to confirm. Then enter a “supervisor “ who didn’t even take time to understand what the problem was and said without a care in the world right to our faces “oh, we deal with this sort of thing every single day. We send people home “. They never realized the agony we were going through. Never at any point did they produced any document to support their decision, in fact at one point the “supervisor “ disappeared to go retrieve an internal document that supposedly has the latest updates but returned 10 minutes later empty handed. They absolutely had no clue about what they were saying and could not even take a moment to check the requirements for our country of destination and the CDC website. What a total customer care failure and a huge embarrassment to the company! To say we were deeply disappointed is an understatement. It is a fact once one has tested COVID positive, it is not advisable to retest until after at least 90 days because chances are high that they can still test positive even though they are not contagious. This fact doesn’t seem to make sense to KQ check in clerks, or at least the two I was dealing with.

We then received (on Christmas Eve) a link to our supposedly 'new flights' which had a time frame to a payment portal from 15h00-17h30/18h00 roughly... let me reiterate, on Christmas Eve, who is checking their emails to rebook flights in such a short time frame? We then tried to access the portal that night at 19h00 and we could not access it to pay an additional fee (when this was supposed to be fully refunded I might add) for our flights in April.

154,"We flew from JFK to NBO just before the pandemic was declared. This was the first leg of a journey to Seychelles (SEZ). We found the cabin crew on this flight to be excellent, attentive, and really friendly. It seemed that the cabin staff were up and down the aisles very frequently and had a smile on their faces, something that must be tough during these times. We told them how pleased we were at the end of the flight and they seemed genuinely surprised to get the positive feedback. We passed this on to the airline via their website but have received no response as yet. Check in at JFK was easy, but probably atypical due to the reduced number of flyers in early March this year. The same could be said for the boarding process. The plane itself was new, a lovely 787 with mood lighting and big windows. The legroom was reasonable (not cramped but not luxurious). Overall it was comfortable for such a long journey. The food on the outbound journey was really good, way better than we expected, and our son' child's meal was also better than typical kids meals. The biggest negative on our outbound journey was the entertainment system. There were very few recent movies and the choice was extremely limited. Take your tablet or phone and download some eBooks, movies or other entertainment to it. if you are expecting to use the system on the plane to keep you occupied for 14 hours you will be disappointed. If I was rating the airline based on this flight I would actually give this flight 4 or even 5 stars as it was enjoyable but external factors are influencing that rating. Our return journey from Seychelles was delayed overnight by 14 hours and we had to fight to get accommodation. Due to this delay, and the Kenyan government ban on entry for foreigners due to COVID-19, it also meant our mini KQ Safari booked through the airline had to be cancelled. This is all very understandable and we have no issue with any of that. We cancelled this over email with the safari division while in the Seychelles and assumed there would be no issue. However, despite meeting 3 of the criteria needed for refund I am now going through a VISA charge-back process to recover this fee. First they say to talk to travel agent (when we booked the safari directly through them on a different credit card number) and then they say its valid for a year and they do not refund services .. despite having a clear statement on their website that a refund can be done if you fit 1 of the 3 criteria - 1. contact the email provided within 24 hours of the safari to cancel (we did it 6 days before), 2. Have a flight cancellation or delay (we were cancelled and put on a flight 14 hours later), and 3. Being denied entry to the country (the government were denying foreign nationals even with a visa - which we had).

This flight was a short 4 hour flight. Nairobi Airport itself if not the best for transit, though we spent the 7 hour layover in the Pride Business Class Lounge (having paid $40 for a day pass) which was satisfactory. Cabin Crew appeared a little unfriendly on arrival onto aircraft, though pleasant with requests and service. The aircraft itself appeared old and tired, and could benefit from modernisation. For a small flight, a light meal was provided, which in honesty was good (Asian Vegetarian). Sadly few flight announcements and no advice that the plane was descending into Mauritius and landing - it just landed! No inflight entertainment - screen did not work! Finally the timing of this flight is not good. Arrival at Mauritius at 0300 in the morning is strange and untimely.

163,"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Nairobi on 5th February 2020. Both flights on newer B787-8 aircrafts. Check-in and luggage handling went smoothly, but had to fight a bit with ground staff to get all my BPs issued on spot. Booking handling online works well. Their AF-KLM lounge offered in Bangkok is poor (like Thai Airways lounges) but their Pride lounge in Nairobi is good and spacious. Hardware on Kenya Airways is good and they are good on ground to tackle even complicated issues. The FAs are also good, plenty, observant. They are mainly Kenyans which does not help Chinese nor Thai passengers much. The very weak point of Kenya Airways is the food. Business class does not provide food any better than their Economy class and is plain, without vision, looking shabby. Competing airlines like Ethiopian, Turkish, South African, and Egypt serves much better and inspiring food in their economy class. Steel cutlery and table preparation nice. But that’s it. Dinner from BKK was a cold shabby dish with chopped salad and 3 ridiculous small pieces of sliced meatballs. Breakfast offered was inedible continental or fried rice. Very poor offerings. No meat, no cocktails, no cheeses, no ice cream, no smoothies, chocolates, no fruits (watermelon does not count). Extremely poor catering, a disgrace for the airline. Beverages are shamefully very sparse, only 2 juices (apple or orange) are offered. Wines are only passable. Beers are cheap, waterish industrial stuff: 2 brands, Tusker and Heineken – not providing any alternatives to each other. No souvenir, no pyjamas, no luxury feelings at all. No lobster, no seafood, no caviar, no mutton, goat, pork, no beef, no chicken (maybe inside the breakfast sausage).

164,"Not Verified |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. As a fairly regular flier, this was one of the most disappointing flights I’ve ever been on. The Boeing 787 is a great plane, but from check-in to baggage collection and everything in between I was underwhelmed. The aircraft interior is tatty and dirty with frayed seat covers and ripped seat-back pockets that your phone falls through the holes. The cabin service only started 45 minutes after take-off, no water or drinks and they first serve their very mediocre meals before you get a small plastic cup of water which we got 1 hour into the flight. Then the dirty trays only get cleared around an hour after meals are served so you can’t stow the tray table and sleep until they’ve cleared the cabin. On both the flight to Bangkok and the return sector I tried in vain to call a cabin attendant using the call button, but they literally walk past you with the blue light glaring and carry on doing whatever they’re busy with.

When Kenya was finally reached they said they never received our payment. 2.5 hours later we missed our flight. Next day we start phoning them at 7am. When they finally answered they started this thing where they will tell you to please hold but end the line. After the fourth call we got through and the woman said we can fly at 14:30. At 10am we were at the airport at ticket sales. Once again no e-ticket and no response. By 12:30 we get the news.

183,"I was to fly on Sept 7th 10.55 pm Kenya time from Nairobi to New York/JFK. I got to the airport and cleared 3 rounds of security checks. After reaching the boarding gate, it was announced that the flight is delayed and now will depart at 1 am.   Around 9.30, they made another announcement that the flight is further delayed and will depart at 2 am. We were offered some dinner and around midnight asked to proceed towards the boarding gate where there was another round of security clearance, there is no water available beyond this point unless it’s a sealed bottle bought at duty-free.   At around 2.45, when there was no sight of a plane and when we inquired with the ground staff, Kenya Airways personnel made an announcement that the flight is canceled and will now depart at 2 pm the next day.   We were given transit visa voucher, however, upon getting to the Immigration line, were told the voucher is void without KA personnel signature. By this time, all of us were frustrated due to lack of proper communication and guidance.   After we cleared the long queue at Immigration, we got to the KA desk for the hotel reservation. There was no clarity or communication around hotel assignment. We had to hand over our boarding passes at random to agents who’d then shout out the names of passengers. As the lines grew longer, their ability to manage crowds and cater to our needs diminished – they were not able to answer simple questions such as which hotel to go to, when our bus/shuttle would arrive or what the process would be thereafter.   We managed to get to our assigned hotel at around 4.30 am. The wifi in the room was not working so we could not communicate with family regarding our whereabouts. The bedspread was torn and the bathroom had roaches and other insects. With barely 3 hours of sleep, we woke up to get breakfast which was below average.   We left for the airport by airport shuttle where the KA agent only provided boarding pass for the flight to JFK. The agent asked me to go to the gate to collect boarding pass for the flight from JFK- PHX. After reaching the gate, I was asked to go to the KA desk so the agent can further help with flight changes. I had specifically requested to be booked onto an earlier flight which the agent at the main counter confirmed was the case. However, the agent at the KA desk near the gates could not help and said they could book me only on the 8 am flight to Phoenix the following day – after an 8+hour wait at JFK airport, she said my seat was confirmed for this flight. The agent also confirmed my bags would be checked all the way through to Phoenix and just that I had to collect my boarding pass at KA counter at JFK.   At the fourth security check, I asked another KA agent if my bags would be through checked to Phoenix – she said I would have to collect them at the port of entry which is NY/JFK.  The flight which was to depart at 2 pm was delayed by an hour and departed Nairobi at around 3 pm. The in-flight service was poor, the agents were rude. I asked the attendant for an additional blanket as I started feeling the chills but I never got any.   We landed at JFK around 10.30 pm.

On the good side, flight hours are convenient from Johannesburg to Paris and route is short. Flights were all on time, with short connections. KQ is part of the AF-KLM Flying Blue programme and that's very convenient (I'm Silver and got 3x23 kilos). FAs were fine and as already experienced on KQ they tended to be very generous on alcohol. On the downside KQ offers very poor service. IFE is extremely poor, with a very limited choice of films, most being rather old films, and the selection did not change between late July and late August! Besides IFE did not always work fine (sound problem on one flight). Food was very limited and very bad, particularly on 8 hour flight to Paris: no real dinner but just a fat meat roll, breakfast very bad - but food better from CDG as on so many airlines. NBO airport is small and clean, it was not crowded but very dull and very limited service. Ground staff at OR Tambo wanted us to pay for our children's car seats (about $ 400!) because on the website it was written that car seats were free for ""infants"" and they said children (aged 4 and 9) are not ""infants"" - very absurd rule! Hopefully the agent at the ticketing office was shocked by the price and sorry for us and finally they dropped the surcharge (as always, be kind with ground staff and stay calm!). Yet we saw latter the same ground staff member telling very rudely to a passenger going to Malawi that he would have to pay for a not-so-big cabin bag he was carrying.

A 3-hour delay out of Nairobi with no prior communication from the airline despite the fact that they ask for both your phone number and email address when you check in online. I actually received a text advising me of the delay after we landed in Johannesburg a full 3 hours late.

I'm skeptical that a technical issue on one airplane could cause that many delays, given the size of the airline and the different aircraft types it operates. The flight itself was fine, despite several irate passengers taking their frustration out verbally on the cabin crew who kept up a cheerful demeanor as much as they could. Food on KQ is nothing special, a tiny main course and a bread roll and bit of cake. Entertainment options are fine but don't seem to be updated much.

200,"Not Verified |  New York to Dar es Saalam via Nairobi. We will never fly this airline again. We flew JFK to Nairobi non-stop on June 29th and returning on July 11th. Firstly, the customer service is unbelievably terrible. Every stewardess  was rude, and never helped . They huffed and puffed when you kindly requested something as simple as some water (flight was over 14 1/2 hours). Secondly, they refused to accommodate anyone for seat changes, even when the customer is paying the upcharge. Third, we requested to get skymiles added from this trip and they refuse to give us our credit due to our ""class"". They are a part of the SkyTeam. We spent extra money on exit row seats and spent a lot of money for the tickets. How are we not getting any mileage credit built up from this. This is probably the number one reason I will never fly with this airline ever again. I am so angry with this. Bathrooms were dirty and never cleaned or restocked. There was several times that I had to walk to the back of the plane to find a stewardess and ask them to put more toilet paper in the bathroom or if there was any way they could clean the urine off the floor in every single one of the bathrooms. We paid for exit seats for the additional leg room and the stewardesses never said anything to the 15 people that decided to congregate in my extra leg room area and stand there conversating for over 2 hrs. I asked them kindly to relocate several times and even said something to the stewardesses several times. Finally, they moved after I had to make them (very frustrating).

201,"Dubai to Kigali via Nairobi on 30th June 2019 on B787-800 and E190, respectively. My ticket was in economy and very cheap. I bid for an upgrade for the 1st leg and it was accepted 2 days before and they reissued ticket. However, due to serious delays by Cathay Pacific entering Dubai (from Saigon and Hong Kong), I realised almost a day before that I would not be able to make my trip from DXB. I cancelled my online check-in’s to avoid No Show, but had to forfeit upgrade and tickets according to fare rules. However, KQ, and in particular the Station Manager in DXB, went the extra mile to still get me on board on the following flight 5 hours later on the same day. This, without reissuing tickets (which were non refundable), without charging me for No Show, without loosing my upgrade, just out of courtesy, empathy and a well explained case from my side. At gate in DXB, I was the last person (had only 40 Minutes for transfer, so got a good morning run!), but KQ issued all my BPs in 2 Minutes during last call. Onboard, spacious cabin, got seat 2C in a nice 2 x 2 x 2 configuration. Flight full except a few seats in business. Good food and kind, attentive FAs. A decent airline respecting classic values and handles “ground situations” or irregularities well. Not the first time they have done small miracles for me. In NBO, I was kindly invited to the KQ Pride lounge that Skyteam uses. Just a courtesy due to my endured inconveniences. Last leg on an E190, I love this aircraft.

The Station Manager in ADD went the extra mile to get me onwards the same day and he invited me to the Ethiopian Gold Lounge, that Skyteam uses.

The prestigious lounge has food, views, and nice architecture with curving designs and view of tarmac. It has 6 beds in silent area and I slept well till next morning.

Smooth cooperation with KQ and the AF lounge in BKK allowed me to relax in the lounge 6 hours until Kenya Airways could issue all 4 Boarding Passes of my ongoing trip to Kigali via Addis. Buying 2 tickets with complicated routing (married segments) turned out to be much cheaper than go direct. But time spent increases; likewise the risk of lapses. All flights punctual. Food only passable, only 2 options offered and only cold dishes for dinner. No cheese, no ice-cream. Other airlines do better in Economy regarding food. Drinks also very narrow offering with 2 industrial, cheap beers. Same for wines: only 1-2 options. Champagne offered (on both flights) was fine: JM Gobillard & Fils.

207,"Nairobi to Dakar via Abidjan. I have no idea why the airline is called the Pride of Africa. Maybe because it compares to some other very bad airlines in the region. Ok, the plane seemed good and the seats had a PTV which is pretty good and a newly introduced feature. That's about it. At Jomo Kenyatta the check in was slow, even for those having done a check in online, we had to wait in a line, no one told us which line to wait in and of course no drop off line, unlike advertised in the web page ... and there is no point in using the self check in machines, as you still have to go on the line  inside the airport, which is not the fault of the airline it is really hot and crowded, but the airline did not help because their boarding was done all at the same time, no groups. Once in the tarmac, maybe because they wanted to use only one bus, they waited a long time until we were really crowded and people started complaining and saying they would not get in the bus, then they took us to the plane where we waited about 5 to 10 minutes on the tarmac again (luckily it was sunny). We board the plane and have to wait almost one hour because the pilots do not have a flight plan. I go to the toilet even before taking off and it is very dirty already. Food was really bad for an almost 10h flight. Seat covers were falling off some seats. Entertainment is good but there is a problem... every time you open a new film, or show or whatever, it shows you the same publicity again, (we are already flying Kenya airways, no need to see the publicity 20 times). The publicity lasts about 7 minutes and runs over the show, so once your movie or show begins, you've lost a few minutes of it . that is something that they must fix. In the stopover, we were advised that we had to wait in the plane about 30 minutes. We waited 2h without air conditioning, over 40 degrees, people complaining, doors closed and of course no APU on, nor auxiliary power, why?  Food from Abidjan to Dakar was really bad .. a cold hard muffin and a mince pie that tasted so bad and was so dry many did not eat it. Anyways for a 2h flight you can't expect much, but in total it is a 10h flight for many so it is rubbish. Both landings were quite hard and I am an airline fan and private pilot. The second one can be justified due to wind, but the first one, surprised about it. In general, very good plane, nice flight attendants, and good entertainment system.

218,"Harare to New York via Nairobi. I was super excited to travel to Zimbabwe and see Africa for the first time and got the perfect excuse when one of my closest friends from college planned her wedding in Harare. My outbound flight on American Airlines was cancelled due to weather, leading to me missing my connecting flight on Kenya Airways. While this was unpleasant, no one can control the weather, and AA helped re-book me on a later Kenya Airways flight into Harare, Zimbabwe, so I made it on time to the wedding. After a few weeks of seeing Victoria Falls and making friends with lions, I got back to check into my flight back to New York with Kenya Airways. The attendant there let me know that I had been marked as a “no-show” on my outbound flight, and now my return ticket was cancelled as a result. After arguing that I clearly was re-booked on a later outbound flight, Kenya Airways told me I could get on the flight if I paid a “penalty” of $1200. As I had already paid for a round trip ticket, I indignantly refused to pay for my flight a second time and wound up missing the morning flight. Two more flights back to the States came and went, and I missed all of those flights as Kenya Airways demanded payments to let me onto a plane. I racked up hours of international cell phone call payments with American Airlines customer service and my travel agent, who all let me know that Kenya Airways was not picking up the phone, and they were the only ones who could get me on one of their planes. 16 hours later, having missed every flight that day, I finally gave in and paid the $1200 penalty, in addition to the $1600 round trip ticket I had already paid, and Kenya Airways let me on the flight back home. For the privilege of nearly doubling the cost of my plane ticket, I also had a 17 hour layover in Nairobi, after which Kenya Airways told me my flight to JFK was overbooked. Fortunately Kenya Airways did one thing right and found a seat for me onto the flight back to the States, which I had paid for twice.

219,"Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. The feeling I got flying Kenya Airways for the first and last time is that it’s missing a certain culture which is so important for customer loyalty. Our trip  was the worst I’ve ever taken with any airline. And I’ve flown a lot. Everything was matter of fact. Except for the last leg from Nairobi to Cape Town through Victoria Falls (which was still the wrong return flight and 24 hours too late) all flights were delayed between two and twelve hours. The on-board meals are half the size of comparably-priced flights and mostly junk. Drinks cart selection looks like Aeroflot in the 80’s. Kenyans are warm and inviting. Is there a reason why that cannot be the same at Kenyatta airport? Is Kenya Airways not the major airline of that airport? When there’s no culture at the top, there’s no culture on the ground. Rude immigration officers, and security personnel throwing bins at passengers. The “hotel desk” which had no signs was another terrible experience. Apathetic employees did the minimum required of them. Passengers already furious to have been delayed prior, and now having missed their connections, would have to wait till morning to catch the next (wrong) flight. And when you get your hotel sorted, you’re told the bus will leave “very soon” but the truth is they wait until enough people cram the bus and only then transfer the passengers to the hotel. And everything is done at snail pace, with total disregard and matter of fact. There are many wonderful and accommodating employees along the way, but that is not the point. We all tend to remember the negative and unpleasant, but the right kind of culture has no room for negative. Customers have choice, and if enough customers stop using Kenya Airways, will that make its point?

When we arrived 2 hours prior to our flight to check in, we were told that the flight was full. Despite the fact that we had arrived within the requested time to check in and had paid 2 months prior to the flight, we were kicked off the flight. There were multiple other passengers that also were not able to check in because of too many ticket sales - 1 of them had been able to buy a ticket that same morning online despite there obviously not being any left! We purchased our tickets 2 months ago - how were there still tickets on sale the same morning and yet we, who purchased our tickets 2 whole months ago were kicked off the flight?! This is unacceptable!! Another had arrived 2.5 hour prior to departure and had still been kicked off. He had also purchased his tickets much later than we had! We were out in a hotel for the night with boarding passes printed for the next flight in 24 hours but also with the promise by Kenya Airways staff that early the next day they would try to find an alternative flight to get us to Dar Es Salaam earlier. We were already going to miss our airport pickup, who was taking us straight onto a 3-day safari for which I had already paid $300 US for. We were interrupted during breakfast to rush back to the airport.

They couldn’t tell us arrival time in Dar Es Salaam but checked in our bags and a long time later gave us boarding passes. On checking them, we discovered our route would now include a 26-hour stopover in Addis. Not only were we leaving a day later than our initial flight, but we would be now be arriving 48 hours later - a whole 24 hours later than if we had gone with the later Kenya Airways flight. On showing the staff at Kenya airways what they had swapped us over to, they then told us the Kenya Airways flight that night was already full and we couldn't fly. Seriously, this was ridiculous.

This flight actually would stop in Zanzibar first, thus arriving in Arusha at 3:10 am. I was aware of that flight. I had to ask if there was an earlier flight - hen and only then did the staff say, ""There is a Precision Air flight at 10:50pm."" I replied ""and is that a direct flight"". She answered ""yes"". I then had to connect the dots for the Kenya Air staff (as obviously they are not trained to use common sense or think of their customers at all).

At that point the stars aligned and she asked if I would prefer that flight, well yes, I would prefer getting to my lodge 3 hours earlier as it would be the middle of night! It gets better.

242,"Entebbe to London via Nairobi. I recently spent some time volunteering in Uganda and whilst I was there broke and dislocated my ankle quite badly. I needed to return home a few days earlier than planned, to undergo surgery, so rebooked a flight at additional cost and requested wheelchair assistance. Upon arrival at entebbe airport, they seemed unaware of my situation despite having been informed, but did sort out some help. I also asked if it would be possible to be upgraded if there were spare seats in business class as it was important to keep my leg, which was in a cast, elevated as much as possible and particularly during a flight when it may swell more. The check in desk confirmed there were seats but that they couldn’t upgrade me there but that it should be possible in Nairobi where I would change to take an 8.5hr flight to London. At the gate in Nairobi I once again asked if it would be possible to sit in business class so I could elevate my leg. The man on the desk said that he couldn’t do anything without invoicing me but it was his attitude rather than refusal that really annoyed me. He was completely unsympathetic, laughing at me and treating me as if I was just trying to get some free perks. I was clearly in pain and the most annoying thing was that the flight was actually half full. As a goodwill gesture he’d ‘upgraded’ me to the seats with more legroom but as I explained to him when he did so, that would not help as there was nothing to rest my leg on, so it was still dangling down, putting pressure on the ankle and causing swelling. This seat was also very awkward to get in and out of due to the way the screens came out of the seat from the side and had no additional room to the side as the armrests were fixed. However, it did provide me with a great view of the business class section which was virtually empty, and I was galled to see there were several passengers in economy with at least 4 seats to themselves, enabling them to lie down for the entire flight and had they so wished to elevate their leg! At no point had the man on the desk mentioned that there were many spare seats which would have enabled me to elevate my leg quite comfortably, despite me explaining the issue. None of the air hostesses expressed any concern for my situation throughout the flight despite my obvious discomfort and attempts to create a platform from bags and cushions to rest my leg on. Whilst I understand that other people have paid for the benefit of a business class seat, I felt that in extenuating circumstances such as this, the airline could have made a goodwill gesture to ensure their passenger’s wellbeing and comfort. I will not be recommending them to others and certainly won’t be rushing back to travel with ‘the pride of Africa’ any time soon.

249,"Entebbe to Mumbai via Nairobi connecting on Jet Airways to Colombo. The ground staff was acting completely arbitrarily, and each of them had different rules. Our main problem with Kenya Airways was not on board, but with the ground staff. My husband (Ugandan) and I (German) were booked on a flight to Colombo in Sri Lanka. It was a one-way ticket. Since the Sri Lankan Visa is only for 30 days, I had another flight booked with Malaysian Airlines to Cambodia within that period. My husband and I both had E-Visas for Sri Lanka. So when we came to Entebbe Airport, the Kenya Airways Lady at the Check-In counter didn't let us board the airplane. She claimed, that Ugandan citizens weren't allowed to go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa (Our E-Visa was already granted and even certified by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Kampala). Also, she said that we had to have a flight from Sri Lanka back to our home countries and she couldn't let us go there on a one-way ticket. When I told her about our outbound flight with Malaysian, she said that there is ""a rule, that every person has to return to their home countries within one year"", so we had to show her a ticket back to our home countries, otherwhise she wouldn't check us in. As I said, she was acting totally arbitrarily. Unbelievable. So in the end I had to book a flight for each of us back to our home countries (which I of cause cancelled immediatly once arrived in Colombo). I did it right there and then at the airport, but she still had the opinion that our E-Visas weren't ok, so we missed the flight. Then, the lady took us to the Kenya Airways office at the airport and looked for another flight for us. But since ""it was our mistake"" that we missed it, we had to pay for the change fees. She then told us to go to the Sri Lankan High Comission in Kampala the next morning and apply for the normal visa. In general this lady was very rude, when I tried to explain to her that our E-Visas were already approved etc, she told me to shut up and that she was tired of dealing with people like us. So when we went to the embassy, we talked to the ambassador personally and he was completely shocked that they wouldn't let us board the airplane, since Ugandan citizens can go to Sri Lanka on an E-Visa and ours was already approved. He gave us his personal number, so that we could call im in case we would have any problems again. The next day the Check-In lady wasn't there and we had no problems to board the airplane, even though our visa was still the same and no one asked us for return tickets to our home countries. When I sent a customer complaint to the Kenya Airways Customer Service, they answered me that they received it and would forward it to someone from the Customer Service team. But after that, I didn't receive a reply for 1 month. So just recently I e-mailed them again, saying that I am still waiting for a reply, but nothing happend. I am deeply disappointed.

263,"✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to Bangkok via Nairobi. It is obvious why this airline is in deep financial trouble. None of the payment methods on their website work - we tried several different credit cards from different banks from accounts in different countries (including East Africa) and none of them worked. Flights need to be paid for (with an additional fee - they will not waive it even though their website has payment issues) over the phone or through third-party websites. We needed to change our business class tickets to the next day due to unforseeable changes. Although their website says you can do this online, you can't. Again, it wouldn't take any payment method even when we did a 3 way call between our banks and the airline. Their solution was to write an email to their tech department. All of the flight options the website showed were different from what the Kenya Airways representative could see on their end. All of the flight options the representative could see were hundreds of dollars more than what was being shown to us on their website. After several hours (12pm until 7pm) and dropped calls later, they finally booked us a ticket that ended up costing us significantly more and we ended up losing our business class seats. We couldn't pay over the phone and so we were told we could pay at the airport at no extra charge. Upon reaching the airport, the ticketing agent charged us even more than the price on the emailed ticked we had. She refused to call the manager and told us we could either pay the extra money or not get on the flight. Once finally reaching our destination, we tried reaching out to Kenya Airways several times to share our poor experience, hoping they would do something about it to avoid losing our business in the future as we fly into East Africa often to vist family & friends. Instead, we were met with a generic email replies telling us they were ""looking into the situation."" This airline and their customer service is a disappointment.

During that time there was no attempt to serve the business class passengers. It was a long flight. No water bottles provided which is fine because we like to try and keep things environmentally friendly but also had to ask repeatedly for glasses of water. Had to help ourselves to pillows and blankets from a bin. They ran out of 2 of the 3 choices of breakfast by row 4 in business class. The USB charger in my seat didn't work.

Our negative and unpleasant experience with Kenya Airways culminated in the loss of my wife's luggage upon arrival in Johannesburg. After numerous phone calls and emails, absolutely nothing was done to locate this luggage and eventually the airline merely admitted that it was untraceable. None of our calls were ever returned, we received differing stories of the bag not being loaded first in Hanoi and then in Nairobi. It became quite obvious from the outset that the airline did not care about this problem and could not be bothered to help us. The flight experience was unprofessional, tardy, and disrespectful towards the passengers. Traveling between Hanoi and Nairobi felt like the passengers were alone on the flight and when the air hostess staff were visible, they were sullen, impatient and obviously cared very little for the wellbeing and comfort of the passengers on board. Upon boarding the flight in Hanoi, we were not greeted by a single staff member. Passengers were sleeping in incorrect seats and no air hostess could be found to assist us. Food was served with an air of contempt and annoyance. The hot breakfast consisted of a stale croissant and fruit. Drinks were served once on the flight. Trays took more than an hour to be cleared.

279,"✅ Verified Review |  My Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to Paris (a codeshare with Air France) was delayed and eventually left 14 h after the scheduled time. We had to queue for almost an hour at 1.30 am to get a voucher for a taxi as they were all written by hand and we were not given a hotel voucher, just told to go to a hotel (which very kindly took us in based on our word that our flight was delayed). We did not collect our luggage. We were told by KQ staff at the airport that we would be collected at 11 am the following day. The next morning I looked at my booking on the internet to see that the plane was scheduled to leave at 11 am. I took a taxi to the airport from the city and when I checked in I was told that the plane was leaving at 11 am. I got the same message at the boarding gate where they were getting ready to accept passengers. The airport staff seemed not to be aware that there were 200+ passengers in hotels in Nairobi. We had to wait for them to arrive. We were then told to go to gate 13 but the plane was at gate 14. We left 14 hours late. Kenya Airways staff made no public announcements during the whole of this shambles, and no apology was given until we heard from the pilot that passengers had to be collected from Nairobi.

The 787 is certainly an improvement in comfort and reduce negative effects of flying, but the Business Class of Kenya Airways is just no match for the price, which is 40% more than competition. All in the service is just behind. Lie flat seat is ok but already look old after couple of years, and the conception is already ancient (manual handset with a wire). Service is just too basic for the price you pay, and the staff is pretty cold, un-attentive and seem bored every time you ask something (not all of them, there are couple of pursers really doing it right, but the rest is awful). I am not asking much as flying is a commodity but a minimum of politeness when coughing up 5,000 USD for a 7h flight is a fare expectations, as the level of service is nowhere representative of that. Premium Economy in some European carriers is actually better service for 1/3 of the fare. Meal service is quite basic, you get the plates and in 5 min they are taken out.

One of my reading lights didn't work but these things happen with airlines. The crew was great, the cabin was spotless and meal delicious. They held the connecting flight to Mombasa for me, something that airlines promise but rarely do. That flight had a newish aircraft, charming crew and clear flight deck announcements. They served a warm breakfast, not bad for a 45 minute flight. KQ were equally good on a flight to London a couple of years ago after I slipped a disc and had to be taken home in a wheelchair. I was looked after perfectly until I reached Heathrow. My only criticism is the fault of Kenya Airports Authority. It is unbelievable in the 21st century that to get to JKIA's domestic terminal, you have to push your heavy luggage cart across an enormous car park with kerbs, busy traffic and dubious individuals who want to relieve you of your luggage temporarily - or perhaps permanently. There is no reason not to have a level, paved, lit, signposted pathway - after all if Kenya can get Chinese contractors to finish a brand new railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi with gleaming new stations and viaducts six months early, they can't prevail on the Chinese to build a simple path in a week - if the work is too onerous to do themselves, that is. Or would that deprive freelance porters of income?

Since our luggage was not checked through we were told we should proceed to immigration collect our luggage then check into our Kenya Airways flight. The minute we arrived with lateness we asked some official in the airport where to go. They pointed us towards the connections area up some stairway. We proceeded to the Kenya Airways desk, the staff were a bit clueless as to what to do until we were told to go to another desk, who in turn told us to talk to BA. After bouncing around a few desks (running) we knew we were not going to make our flight and our luggage would be left in the collection belt. We decided to miss the flight and try for a later one. The Kenya Airways staff were absolutely unhelpful. When trying to purchase the tickets we were sent to another desk, guess what, they don't take cards. And the tickets were 320$ each. At this desk we were finally told the only way to sort this was to go through immigration, collect our luggage, go to the other terminal to another Kenya Airways desk, buy our tickets then check in. In my lifetime of travelling, this was one of the most gruelling and awful experiences I have ever had. After collecting our luggage and walking outside being accosted by random ""officials"" trying to make a quick buck and people trying to scam us we made our way to the Kenya Airways office. They then offered us a pair of tickets which were now $420 each, apparently our no show on the flight we missed incurred a fee. They were taking advantage of the situation despite none of this being our fault, and only due to their incompetence. We had no choice but to buy the tickets and move on.

285,"✅ Verified Review |  I am back to say a big thank you to Kenya Airways. I traveled from Moshoeshoe airport in Lesotho on Feb 12, 2017 by Maluti Sky. That flight was delayed and I had a very short time for international transfer at OR Tambo. Not surprisingly, my luggage, which had been checked to Johannesburg was left behind. I barely made it through check-in in time for my flight KQ761 to JKIA.

287,✅ Verified Review |  This has to be one of the worst travel experiences ever. I would never recommend Kenya Airways. They changed our departure date by 1 day from Maputo to Amsterdam (via Nairobi) without even advising us. This meant I had to change my ongoing flights to Toulouse and Belfast as I had booked and paid EasyJet for these. Kenya Airways refuse to reimburse me the cost of changing the tickets. Then when we went to check in at Maputo Airport and were told that our tickets had been cancelled and we were not on the flight. That was a very stressful 30 minutes. Finally they advised us that we could check in. The Boeing 787 from Amsterdam to Nairobi was terrible. Poor choice of movies. Very cramped. Terrible cold breakfast. Tasteless dinner.

288,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Bangkok via Nairobi. Terrible airline - do not book Kenya Airways! We originally booked our Johannesburg to Bangkok tickets via Nairobi because of the short travelling time - there was only a 1-1.5 hour layover in Nairobi each way. Months after booking the ticket, Kenya Airways rescheduled our flights so that there was a 7 hour layover in Nairobi. The 7 hour layover ended up 5 hours longer than expected because the flight to Bangkok was severely delayed (this after our flight to Nairobi had been delayed by 2 hours and used a different aircraft that did not have in flight entertainment). The 5 hour delay severely impacted our plans in Thailand, creating great inconvenience and forcing us to make additional travel arrangement to the island we were staying on, at our own expense. When we raised these concerns with the Kenya Airways service desk at Nairobi airport, we were told that they could not assist us and we had to log a complaint with Kenya Airways customer service. My partner logged a complaint - we have still had no reply to this. We faced the same experience on our return flights - the flight from Bangkok to Nairobi was delayed by 3 hours which meant we missed our connecting flight to Johannesburg and were put on the next flight out - another 7 hour wait at Nairobi airport. Then we were notified that we had been moved to a later flight that evening because a smaller aircraft had to be used. When we eventually arrived back in Johannesburg, my partner's bag had been left in Nairobi. The agent at the Kenya Airways luggage desk told us it would be couriered to us the next morning - it was only delivered at 10pm the next night. Our flights with Kenya Airways ended up being the worst travel experience of any airline - we ended up spending over 20 hours extra at Nairobi airport as well as 5 hours extra at Johannesburg and Bangkok airports due to KQ delays - an entire day of our holiday lost due to their inefficiencies.

298,"✅ Verified Review |  Djibouti to Zanzibar via Niarobi. Some friends and I decided to take a short trip to Zanzibar over an extended weekend for about four days. Unfortunately, more than 1/3 of our trip ended up being spent in transit. I am thoroughly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and competence repeatedly displayed by the Kenya Airway agents in the Nairobi airport. The first flight to Nairobi was more than an hour late. When we arrived in Nairobi we immediately went to the Kenyan Airways counter, knowing we had missed our connection. The attendant at the counter told us there were not any other flights that would get us into Zanzibar that day and the only one available left close to midnight and we would arrive the next morning. This was a lie. We waited a bit and went to another desk and the person there found a flight leaving that evening and though we still spent more than 12 hours in the airport, it would get us into Zanzibar about 11 p.m. When leaving the airport from Zanzibar on the return flight Sept 4 the personnel at the counter (Precision Air) would not print both our boarding passes, they told us we had to get them at the desk in Nairobi. We had a 1 hr and 15 min layover and immediately went to the desk to get our tickets. Of course the queue was very long and half the customers ignored it and walked right up to the desk - which the Kenya Airline employees did not seem to care about. When the first of our group arrived at the desk we still had just over 30 minutes before our flight left. We had already spent 30 minutes in line because of the horrible time management and inefficiency of the staff. When we arrived at the desk the gentleman told us we missed our flight. Again, we still had 30 minutes to get to the flight and should have already been checked in when we checked in at the Zanzibar airport. They then told us even if we were first in line at the desk when the plane landed (an hour before takeoff) we still would not have been able to board the plane. Why not? Why would they sell us a ticket on Kenya Airways own website that was a fraud? The entire time we are talking with the desk people they are again, randomly talking to other customers who just walked up (like the outraged lady who was supposed to being going to one location but the Kenya Airways attendants booked her to the wrong country - I didn't really blame her), checking their phones, and essentially being some of the most atrocious customer service representatives imaginable. They were flippant and did not care. To make the long story shorter, we were stuck in the airport until after midnight before we were moved to a hotel then returned the next morning for an afternoon flight - which was of course delayed a couple times.

306,"✅ Verified Review |  On the Nairobi-Mumbai route, Kenya Airways uses a B737-800. Their logo mentions ""The Pride of Africa"" but there is not much to be proud about that flight: miserable breakfast (poached eggs are just warm hard-boiled eggs, no yoghourt offered, tasteless fruit, bad coffee). Seats are antiquated and hardly recline, on the VDO, games were blocked. Fortunately, the crew is very attentive and very pleasant. Choice of reading materials is very limited. Upon arrival in Mumbai, my luggage was missing.

307,"Very impressed with the service offered on these flights. We had missed our booked flight (ET direct from Djibouti to Addis Ababa) so re-booked at the last minute onto Kenya Airways. Even at this late stage, the fare was good and we departed a few hours later than originally planned. The aircraft was clean with comfortable seats (much better than ET on similar routes) and drinks and a small meal were served. All of excellent quality. On the first sector, the crew was headed up by a Purser who was excellent in his customer service and clear announcements in both French and English. The crew had a good sense of humour and were ready to assist in whatever way they could. Transit was via the new airport terminal in Nairobi. One word: Wow! This terminal is exceptional and must be the easiest to navigate, most comfortable I have experienced on the continent. It beats JNB, CPT and others hands-down. Processing was swift and comfortable, shops were open as were a selection of restaurants. There is clearly more to come from this airport as a number of shops seem to be preparing to open. Gate rooms are open and comfortable with access to bathrooms nearby. Fantastic new airport! Our onward flight to Addis was also good. We had to wait for a large party of late passengers but the crew were thoughtful enough to offer us a glass of water or orange juice while we awaited the late-comers. Much appreciated. Another light meal (breakfast) and drinks were served during the flight. Seats were comfortable and I slept well.

311,"I have flown with Kenya Airways before and would describe them as being cheap and cheerful with slightly above average service. Flights to Johannesburg were on time however they ran out of meal choices and we were left with a rather disgusting fish affair. I had chosen Kenya Airways primarily because of their generous baggage allowance ie 2 x 23kg bags as we were bringing sports equipment and motorcycle gear on our holiday. All went reasonably well even given the poor meals on the outbound flight however coming back was a different matter. When we arrived at Johannesburg Airport we were faced with a huge set of scales placed in front of the check in counter that also had its own usual scales. We had to have our bags weighed and the very over officious clerk refused to take my bags as one was 3kg overweight never mind the fact that my other bag was 4kg under weight. I would have understood the concerns if the total of my bags were overweight but they weren't and despite my appeals for a more common sense approach and despite my bags being identically packed to the outward journey (where they were checked in at Heathrow with no problem) I had to repack my luggage on the check in floor. This in my view is a totally ridiculous rule that appears to only be applied at Johannesburg (I have flown Kenya Airways from London, Mombasa and Nairobi on several occasions without any inconvenience). On the flight to Nairobi they again ran out of food choices and we were served by a very rude steward who just slammed the food if you can call it that down in front of us. When we arrived in Nairobi they were bussing those ending their journey there to the terminal but there were no directions for those transitting, we managed to find an emergency exit and took that and were lucky to find a very impatient Kenya Airways employee who directed us to cross a busy airport road in the dark. There was no pedestrian crossing markings and she had no high vis gear on, we were lucky not to get run down by a bus that came around the corner suddenly. The onward flight to Heathrow passed without further incident however the breakfast served was appalling, a piece of unidentifiable gristle in the dish, truly the worst meal I have ever been served in over 50 years of flying.

312,"Flew from London Heathrow to Entebbe via Nairobi. Arrived early for check-in but then had to wait because one of the desks was being occupied by a family who were not travelling business but seemed to be negotiating over buying another ticket. I had booked both tickets and had selected adjoining seats but by the time we had checked in these have been changed. Even though I had paid for the tickets, I was told that I could not be told whether my travelling companion was still sitting next to me – data protection etc. in fact he had been put elsewhere. It was only at the gate that we managed to correct the problem. The aircraft was a newish Boeing 787 Dreamliner and although Kenya Airways had not opted for a more modern seat configuration, it was a relatively comfortable. A slightly larger pillow would have been appreciated. My IFE was not working (photo) although given that I wanted to sleep I was not particularly worried. The cabin crew apologised for not having a printed menu and instead let the passengers look at what appeared to be an email with the food options. The wine was uninspiring and the food lacklustre. However, the cabin crew were excellent: some of them had a slightly mischievous sense of humour, smiling and responded quickly to requests. Arriving at Nairobi was a disaster. First, the aircraft had to be towed in because of construction work and we were then put on a bus and taken to the arrivals terminal. There were no signs for transit passengers and when we asked, we were told that we had arrived at the wrong place. Needless to say nobody bothered to tell us. We then went on another bus and after an absurdly long wait finally got through security. The business lounge in Nairobi was small and we were forced to share a table. We decided to leave early and, eventually, the next flight, to Entebbe, was called. Absolutely no priority was given to business passengers. Although there was a separate line, passengers simply joined whichever was the shortest and the staff did nothing to ensure that those who had paid a premium were given priority treatment.

324,"I don't even know where to start. I lost two days of my vacation due to flight delays from Douala to Dubai and Kenyan Airways gave the worst experience so far. When I was checking-in at the counter, I was quite pleased with a very helpful local ground staff. Before I left, I gave him 5000 CFA as a tip. The flight was delayed 6 hours so I checked in late as well. Suddenly, the staff was asking furiously for additional money because his superior saw him receiving a tip and he had to share the tip with others (couldn't believe) this really happened. He was bugging me in the most creepy way possible so I just decided to give another 5000 and left.  I was supposed to leave Douala at 1PM but we were only informed at around 4PM that they had to check us in overnight because there were some mechanical glitches with their plane. They checked us in at 2-star hotel in Douala for twin sharing-room! The room was like crate. We were finally picked up by van and we headed back to the airport. We boarded one hour late and because we were delayed for one day and I had a couple of connecting flights, my entire flight schedule got messed up. It seemed we were hostaged - not being histrionic but that was the feeling. They didn't issue a new plane ticket and asked us to claim the next ticket in Nairobi. So when we were supposed to catch the next flight from Nairobi to Dubai, we were a few minutes late and we weren't able to catch the flight. After 30 minutes of looking for somebody who can provide us information on how do we board the next flight, we were finally advised that we had to stay overnight in Nairobi and check-in at the hotel - again. There were three of us who were supposed to fly to Dubai. We insisted that they book us Etihad as it was the closest flight that time. They told us that they couldn't book another airline because it would be more expensive for them. They advised us instead that we could book and reimburse the expenses from them (yes, so if you like taking chances, one can consider). So we finally settled to stay overnight after they told us that we would be billeted on a 5-star hotel. We finally arrived at the ""5-star hotel"" only there was no air-conditioning. Yes, a hotel without an AC but a fan. We left Nairobi the following day and flew to Dubai. As soon as I get to Dubai, I requested my travel agent to cancel my return flight and reimburse me with my return flight. They offered instead that they would upgrade my cabin class to business for my return trip. The return trip had minimal delays and the business class experience was ok. But when I landed in Douala my luggage was missing! They told us that our luggage were left behind in Nairobi so we will have to wait the next day to get our luggage.

I'll only mention the AMS to NBO to MBA sections because they were all Kenya flights. The 777-300 ER from AMS to NBO had the 3-3-3 arrangement which meant a little more room than I usually get on other airlines. The food was decent enough the wine ok and plenty off it.

351,Flew from NBO to Jo'burg with friends on golfing holiday (Group of 12). We fly KQ a lot in Kenya and we all knew it's a horrible airline before we booked but we did not have much choice and were ok because KQ normally fly golf bags for free. Nope - they've changed their minds on this route and tried to sting us each for $120 excess baggage. One couple paid and the rest of us refused - they finally let us on because we were holding up the check-in for everyone else. No in-flight entertainment of course but flight was actually on time which is a nice change for KQ. My wife and I booked our seats in advance but found they had been given up to others (part of my group so we did not make a fuss) and my wife and were given seats two rows apart. Luckily other people were prepared to swap so we could sit together. Hopelessly unprofessional airline from time of booking to time of landing but what can you do? I'd never fly KQ if I had a choice.

354,Our flight from Guangzhou to Bangkok was cancelled. This is actually not something unusual. However the handling of this situation by the local staff was an absolute disaster. Initially the flight was delayed for three hours until they eventually made the decision to cancel it. We were put up in a below average hotel and left in the dark about further arrangements. The next day we called them every half hour but they themselves did not know what went on. Furthermore they told us that we could not easily get our luggage. In the end I had to get very angry. Only then did they become more co-operative. However the pilot did not allow the luggage to be released from the airport until the afternoon of the next day.

If KQ management would go the extra step they would graduate into another category. However very often its the individual flight attendants that keep me booking and flying KQ. We flew Economy and Business - both with different experiences. I was about not to book KQ anymore until the new dreamliner came in. Nice aircraft - friendly crew.

Meal was very basic - curried fish with rice a bread roll a small dessert but adequate. Trays were cleared away promptly and cabin lights extinguished allowing plenty of time on the 9h25m sector for sleep. Two hours before landing another hot meal of similar proportions was served. One other bonus the crew were not too obsessed with making pax close their blinds permitting some sunlight in for the last few hours which made waking up a gradual process as blinds were raised one by one.

379,KQ860 NBO-BKK. 767-300. Flight was 99% full and ground staff and FA's were efficient with the boarding process and managed to get everyone seated in time (despite the large amount of duty free items brought on board). There were a lot of Chinese/Thai flight attendants to deal with the Chinese/Thai speaking passengers. Hand luggage size rules were (generally) obeyed by passengers. Flight arrived about an hour early. FA's were friendly and had good English. Good selection of beverages (and generous amounts). Food was also good. Leg room and seat width was adequate. Good magazine. A few noticeable issues: The turning off of electronic devices prior to takeoff and landing was not enforced by staff and staff were also not strict enough with regards to passengers standing up going to the toilets etc. during taxiing. There could have been more thorough pre-takeoff and pre-landing aisle checks for seat belts etc. by the FA's. Sometimes there were no announcements by FA's when the seatbelt sign was turned on by the captain during turbulence and passengers of whom disobeyed the sign were not told to hurry up and sit down - people continued to move around the cabin. There were seat back TV's (channels) but the content was not working (blank black screens on all channels except for the flight data). FA's were notified but could not be fixed. The safety video needs updating and the audio from the loudspeakers was too soft. There were no night aisle walks by FA's with water/juice - they seemed to disappear after the meal service. Overall good for an African airline and has improved over the past years but needs a few more finishing touches before it is on par with a lot of other major international carriers.

389,Terrible experience with Kenya Airways. Flew from London to Nairobi in September. After losing our luggage they didn't seem very concerned or willing to help. We had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another. The next morning we had to fly from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro on Precision Air which is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later. Then they didn't take anyone's luggage on the flight! They told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didn't arrive until 4 days later. By that time we were on Mount Kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear. At no time did the airline offer to reimburse us. Finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on Kenya airways from Nairobi to London. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby! We created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes. Then the flight was 3 hours late departing. Also on both Air Kenya flights the food wasn't very good and the inflight entertainment units didn't work well.

417,We flew from Heathrow to Nairobi on 4th Sep with the flight leaving on time. We managed to get extra legroom seats (row 12) as my husband is 6 ft. 5 and they were fine. Boarding was fairly structured and the food (an evening meal - I chose the veggie option - stuffed peppers) was pretty good - hot and tasty with a snack just before landing for breakfast. I didn't expect much from the IFE from the reviews and wasn't bothered anyway. Some parts of the cabin were a bit frayed around the edges but no real complaints. Crew were fairly attentive. Both internal flights were also fine - a short hop between Nairobi and Mombassa and vice versa - the first left early the second a few minutes late. On both there was time for a snack and a drink with good crew service. Flying back on 13th from Nairobi to Heathrow was fine too - left on time but no extra legroom seats this time so a bit cramped for my husband. IFE was very poor - his seatback TV didn't work and mine was hit and miss. Again no complaints about food. Boarding this time was a bit more chaotic and JKIA is a horrible airport - cramped chaotic and poor flight information. Luggage all arrived with no problems too.

430,A nightmare out of Johannesburg on 16th April. Flight due to take off at 13.20 at 13.45 the Captain announced 9 passengers needed to disembark the aircraft in order to balance the load. A few passengers opted for the US$500 voucher in exchange for disembarking. However an hour later the aircraft hadn't moved. Chief FA then informs passengers that another 10 passengers have to be offloaded. Eventually all passengers had to disembark the aircraft and re-board so calculations could be reconciled with the regulations. At 16.30 after a frustrating 3 hour wait I voluntarily disembarked was taken to the baggage hall to collect my bag only to find all passengers’ baggage had not even been loaded onto the aircraft. Staff lied and tried to pass the buck at every opportunity.

467,As per the previous review I was traveling on the cancelled 2345 flight from Nairobi to Heathrow as part of a round trip. The flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good. Unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment I have ever received from an airline. As the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion. Almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel. This resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places. In particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation; only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms. I suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage. Ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around 6am. The re-scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers. All in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence.,2011-10-23,292,False,as per the previous review i was traveling on the cancelled flight from nairobi to heathrow as part of a round trip the flights in both directions were reasonably good the entertainment systems were broken for most of the seats but staff were pleasant and helpful and food was good unfortunately the reaction to the cancelled flight was awful and the worst treatment i have ever received from an airline as the previous reviewer says the staff were very slow extremely ill informed and seem to have lied on occasion almost no effort was made to inform passengers as to what they needed to do in terms of changing flights getting back through immigration control and sorting out a hotel this resulted in a great deal of frustration and wasted time queuing in the wrong places in particular the airline made very little effort to help passengers find hotel accommodation only one member of staff was available to help and passengers including us were told that there was no hotel accommodation left available which was later proved to be untrue when a number of passengers complained and were miraculously found hotel rooms i suspect the lack of hotel rooms may have related rather more to a lack of appetite to pay the room rates rather than any genuine shortage ultimately we along with perhaps a third of the passengers ended up sleeping on the floor of the transit lounge until we were told to get up and move at around am the re scheduled flight was then further delayed when the first officer did not turn up for work at this point refreshments were provided but not enough for all the passengers all in all a consistent and depressing display of incompetence,-0.9908,negative

482,We were quite disappointed by our first experience of Kenya Airways on our recent trip from London to Nairobi - my husband's TV wasn't working and although we asked for help that was simply ignored. The staff looked bored and were not very attentive. You had to be quick to say that you wanted coffee/tea as you only had one chance much too early during dinner. The food wasn't great but edible. I was also annoyed by the fact that they didn't encourage other passengers to put their seats forward when food was served - that meant we had even less space whilst having our breakfast. The flight back was not quite as bad but still I felt the staff could have made more of an effort (occasional smile would be nice).
